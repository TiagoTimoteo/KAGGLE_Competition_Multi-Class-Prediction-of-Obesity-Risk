# Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of the "Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 2, Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk" Kaggle competition. In this competition, participants are challenged to develop machine learning models capable of predicting the risk of obesity across multiple classes.

## Competition Overview

The goal of this competition is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals into different levels of obesity risk. The provided dataset typically includes information about various health-related factors such as age, weight, height, physical activity level, dietary habits, among others. Based on these features, participants are tasked with creating models that classify individuals into multiple obesity risk classes (e.g., low risk, moderate risk, high risk).
