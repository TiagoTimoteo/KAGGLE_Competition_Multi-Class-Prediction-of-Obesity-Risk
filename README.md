# Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the code and resources developed as part of the "Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 2, Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk" Kaggle competition. In this competition, participants are challenged to develop machine learning models capable of predicting the risk of obesity across multiple classes.

## Competition Overview

The goal of this competition is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify individuals into different levels of obesity risk. The provided dataset typically includes information about various health-related factors such as age, weight, height, physical activity level, dietary habits, among others. Based on these features, participants are tasked with creating models that classify individuals into multiple obesity risk classes (e.g., low risk, moderate risk, high risk).

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the datasets provided for the competition.
- `notebooks/`: Directory with Jupyter notebooks containing the code used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `submissions/`: Location to store model predictions submitted to the competition.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project and competition.

## How to Use

To explore this Kaggle competition project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local environment using the `git clone` command.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to view the code and analysis performed during the competition.
3. Review the datasets in the `data/` folder to understand the features and labels used for model training and evaluation.
4. Check the `submissions/` folder for any model predictions submitted to the competition.
